# sc2-campaign-manager

A Campaign Manager for StarCraft II. Since the game doesnt natively support custom campaigns, and a regular user has to go through hoops to get one running, this tool aims to simplify that process, providing a simple "marketplace" where to download and run custom campaigns.

Uses [electron-react-boilerplate-minimal](https://github.com/f-prime/electron-react-boilerplate-minimal) as a boilerplate.
