The Starcraft 2 Campaign Manager was created as an answer to the need to simplify the deployment of community created campaigns for players. 

The way most custom campaigns work (managing progress and other settings via a mission launcher) prohibits them to work properly via the Arcade, so a single player content enthusiast would often face the hurdle that is playing maps locally: downloading them from a website, placing maps under very specific directories, opening the editor to run the maps, etc). This program streamlines the whole process into a few simple steps: navigate the campaign catalog -> download -> play. That's it!
